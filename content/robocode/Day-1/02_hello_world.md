# 🧪 Your First Java Program

Now that your Java tools are ready, it’s time to write your very first Java program! This tiny adventure checks that everything’s working — and gives your computer its first friendly greeting from you 🤗.

## ✍️ Write the Code

1. In your `src` folder, create a new file named `HelloWorld.java`
2. Type or paste in the following code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

## 🏃‍♀️ Run the Program

Use your terminal in VS Code
* **Windows:** choose PowerShell or Command Prompt via **Terminal → New Terminal**.
* **macOS:** open the integrated terminal or use the macOS **Terminal** app.

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

If everything is set up, you’ll see:

```
Hello World!
```

🎉 Woohoo! That means Java is working, and you're ready to start building robots!
