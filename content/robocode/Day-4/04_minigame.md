# 🎮 Try the PlayerBot! (WASD + Q/E + Space)

Before you start coding your own AI tank, it's important to understand how Robocode movement and firing actually _feel_. To help you do that, we’ve built a special tank that YOU can drive around!

---

## 🧠 What is PlayerBot?

PlayerBot is a manually-controlled robot that you can move using your keyboard. It’s a great way to get a sense of how turning, moving, and firing bullets works in the arena.

# 🧭 What Your Robot Sees (HUD Guide)

Your robot has a special heads-up display (HUD) to help you see what’s going on during the match! Here's what everything means:

## 🎯 Dots on the Compass

Use this guide to understand the colored dots on PlayerBot’s on‑screen compass.

| Dot Colour    | Meaning                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 **Red**    | Opponent’s **current** location (shown right after a scan).                                                           |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Opponent’s **previous** location. The red dot turns yellow once the opponent moves, so you can see where they were last. |
| 🔵 **Blue**   | Direction your **gun turret** is pointing.                                                                            |
| 🟢 **Green**  | Direction your **tank body** is pointing.                                                                             |

Keep an eye on how the red dot switches to yellow—this tells you the opponent has changed position since your last scan.

## 💚 Health Bars

- 🔴 **Red Bar** – The opponent tank's energy
- 🟢 **Green Bar** – Your robot’s energy

---

## 📡 Visibility Info

This section shows what your robot _currently sees_ using its scanner. If it hasn't scanned an opponent recently, it will say "No opponent scanned."

When you _do_ scan an opponent, you’ll see:

- **Angle** – Where the opponent was spotted
- **Opponent ID** – Their unique robot number
- **Opponent X/Y** – The position of the opponent on the map
- **Opponent Energy** – How much health they have
- **Opponent Direction** – Which way they’re moving
- **Opponent Speed** – How fast they’re going

---

## 🤖 Your Robot’s Stats

These numbers help you understand your own tank:

- **Energy** – Your robot’s current health
- **X/Y** – Your robot’s position on the map
- **Heading** – Which direction your robot is facing
- **Gun Heading** – Which way your gun is pointing
- **Radar Heading** – Which way your radar is scanning
- **Gun Heat** – How hot your gun is (can’t fire until it cools!)
- **Speed** – How fast you’re moving

Use this info to aim, dodge, and stay in the fight!

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your PlayerBot and get it running in a Robocode Tank Royale match!

---

### 1. 📁 Download the Launcher

Your instructor will give you a file:

- `PlayerBotLauncher.jar`

Save this file somewhere convenient to find, such as a folder on your Desktop. You can name the folder `PlayerBot`.

---

### 2. 🔐 Start the Local Server and Copy the Secret

1. Start the **Robocode Tank Royale Launcher**.
2. Click **Start Local Server** to create your battle arena.
3. Open the file `server.properties` in your Robocode server folder.
4. Find the line:

   ```
   bots-secrets = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

5. Copy the long secret key after the `=` sign.

---

### 3. 🚀 Launch Your Bot

1. Double-click `PlayerBotLauncher.jar`.
2. Enter the server address (usually `ws://localhost:7654`).
3. Paste your secret key into the secret box.
4. Click **Launch Bot**.

If everything is set up correctly, you’ll see your bot appear in the list of ready bots when starting a match.

---

### 4. ✅ Confirm It's Working

Go back to the Robocode Launcher and click **Start Game**.

- In the list of bots, you should now see **PlayerBot** listed as "Ready".

You're all set! Have fun driving your robot!

If something doesn’t work, double-check the address and secret and make sure the local server is running.
