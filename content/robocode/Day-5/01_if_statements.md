> Curious about **2 - If Statements** 😎

# Making Decisions with `if`

Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` blocks to control actions. The robot can react differently based on battle data.

```java
if (getEnergy() < 30) {
    retreat();
} else if (getGunHeat() == 0) {
    fire(2);
} else {
    ahead(50);
}
```

`if` checks the first condition. If it's false, `else if` offers more choices, and `else` runs if nothing else was true.
