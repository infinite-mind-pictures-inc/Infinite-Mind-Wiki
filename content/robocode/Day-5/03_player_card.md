> Showcase your robot by designing a personalized player card.

Choose the method that matches your course:

- **Self-paced** learners: use the [player card generator website](https://infinite-mind-pictures-inc.github.io/WikiMinigames/cardgen/).
- **Instructor-led** courses: submit your details through the [player card Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeO3NAcXqPCaacO21ZvApGUHdzv9Nuon2acvDtka6GBHQW6Hw/viewform?usp=header).

Open your robot's `.json` descriptor file (for example, `MyFirstBot.json`).
Select all of the text (`Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`) and paste those contents into the
generator when prompted. Be sure you're copying the contents of the file, not
the file itself.

## Capture a Screenshot

Use the Windows **Snipping Tool** to grab a clean shot of your bot during a battle:

1. Open Robocode and start a match so your robot is on screen.
2. Press `Win + Shift + S` to launch the Snipping Tool.
3. Drag to select the battle area you want to capture.
4. Release the mouse to copy the screenshot to your clipboard.
5. Paste (`Ctrl + V`) into Paint or your favorite editor and save the image.

A crisp screenshot looks great on your player card!
