> Pause to reflect on the journey so far.

## Looking Back at Week 1

We started with the basics and steadily built up our robot:

- **Day 1** – Installed Java and Robocode, ran a "Hello World" robot.
- **Day 2** – Wrote a custom robot and learned the VS Code workflow.
- **Day 3** – Introduced variables and datatypes for robot state.
- **Day 4** – Responded to events and printed debug messages.
- **Day 5** – Practiced conditionals and loops to drive behavior.

Take a moment to review your code from each day. Notice how your robot has grown more organized and reactive.

## Questions for Reflection

- Which concepts from this week felt the most challenging?
- What coding habits helped you debug or structure your robot?
- How could your robot improve with the techniques you've learned?
- What goals do you have for the coming week?

Use these questions to guide your notes and plan what to tackle next.
