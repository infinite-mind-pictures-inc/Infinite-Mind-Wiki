# Choose a Natural Disaster

Your EARTH Knight’s story continues with a critical choice: **What kind of natural disaster will your village prepare for?**

* 🌪 **Tornado** – Fast and destructive, with strong winds. What materials will stand up to this?
* 🌊 **Tsunami** – Water rises quickly and crashes down. Is your village near the sea or up high?
* 🌍 **Earthquake** – The ground shakes and cracks. How will you build something stable?
* 🌧 **Flood** – Rising water from rain or rivers. What can you do to protect your resources?

This choice sets the stage for Day 2 — where you’ll need to survive what you’ve imagined. Think like a storyteller and a city planner: What would your character fear? What would they prepare for?

Pick a biome and safe spot to shelter, then use `/sethome` to save it. When the storm hits, use `/home` to return quickly.
