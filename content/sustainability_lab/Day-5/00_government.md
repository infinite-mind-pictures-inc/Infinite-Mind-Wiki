> Let's tackle **1 - Community Government** 🔥
# Plan a Government

Your village needs rules. Discuss options like **consensus**, **monarchy**, **majority rule**, or **anarchy**.

Also decide if you'll be **nomadic or stationary**, whether immigration is open or closed, and what skills newcomers must demonstrate. Plan how youth justice works—punishment, restorative practices, or a mix. Finally, list what you import and export and how those goods travel.
